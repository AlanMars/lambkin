# If this Lambda function uses any libraries, they will be here in the 
# source directory.
#
# We don't want to commit copies of 3rd party libraries to our repository,
# so by default we will ignore _everything_ in the source dir:
*
# ...except for some things we want to commit:
!{{function_name}}.py
!{{function_name}}.js
!metadata.json
!Makefile
!.gitignore
