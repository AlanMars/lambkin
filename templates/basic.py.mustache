# {{function_name}}.py: An AWS Lambda function.
#
# To run this function in Lambda, you need to bundle all the libraries you use.
# Even something as mundane as:
#   import requests
# won't work by default.
#
# To install a library (like "requests") into your Lambda function:
#   pip install requests -t functions/{{function_name}}
#
# or just:
#   pip install requests -t .
#
# if you are already in your function's directory.
#
# The files installed by pip are all "gitignored" by default, so they don't
# get commited. In fact, almost everything is ignored, so if you want to add
# and commit more than just your script, you'll need to bless them in the
# '.gitignore' file in this function's directory.
#
#
# Here is the entry point for Lambda. Execution starts here when an
# event triggers us to run.
#
# Lambda passes us two objects, the event that triggered us, and a 'context'
# object for this execution. For details see:
#   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-programming-model-handler-types.html
def handler(event, context):
    # To log to Cloudwatch, just:
    print "anything you like."

    optional_return_value = {
        "moon_landing": True,
        "color": "#3a3a3a"
    }
    return optional_return_value  # which often becomes a JSON response.
